# ThatMoneyGame
That Money Game is a simulation game that helps children improve their financial skills. 
In the game, children play as a farmer, Somchai. They can build their farm and sell their agricultural products.
But the specialty of this game is that the product prices, time, and economic situation are based on the real world.
